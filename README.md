# RUMAD Backend Accelerator

Welcome to the RUMAD Backend Accelerator program! This repository contains all homework assignments, test cases, and documentation for the course.

## 📚 Viewing Documentation

We've included a documentation viewer to help you browse homework assignments and related files easily.

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the documentation viewer**:
   ```bash
   npm run view-docs
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:3001

The viewer will display all homework assignments, test cases, JSON files, and log files in an easy-to-navigate interface with:
- Beautiful syntax highlighting
- Side-by-side diff viewer for test results
- Resizable sidebar
- Dark theme optimized for coding

### Running Tests

To run the test suite for homework problems:
```bash
npm test
```

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `hw1/`, `hw2/`, `hw3/`, etc. - Homework assignments
  - `README.md` - Assignment instructions
  - `test-cases.json` - Test cases for the homework
  - `boilerplate/` - Starter code
  - `solutions/` - Example solutions (when available)
- `test-problems.js` - Test runner script
- `view_docs.js` - Documentation viewer script

## 💡 Tips

- Use the documentation viewer to easily browse all homework files
- The viewer automatically detects and displays Expected vs Got differences in test results
- You can resize the sidebar by dragging the edge

- Run commands from the repository root directory

The test runner will show you which test cases pass or fail, helping you verify your solutions before submission.

## 5. Push your branch to GitHub
This publishes your branch so instructors can review it.

* The first time you create your branch and publish it:
```bash
git push -u origin yourname/homework
```
* Every time after, you can just do this while on your branch:
```bash
git push
```

## 6. Do not push directly to the main branch
* Your work should only live on your personal branch.
* The main branch is reserved for starter code and instructor updates.

## Pulling Updates

When instructors release new homework or solutions, update your branch:

```bash
# Make sure all your work is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Save my progress"

# Pull the latest updates from main
git pull origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them and commit
```
=======
Happy coding! 🚀
